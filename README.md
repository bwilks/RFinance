This file pulls S&P 500 (Standard and Poor 500) data from 1950 forward.  It then creates a graph three lines. One is the ending weekly value, one is the highest value to that point and one is the average annual return adjusted for inflation (6.87%).
It is designed to compare the current value of the S&P 500 against the average.
